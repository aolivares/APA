\chapter{Potential Applications}
\label{ch:Applications}

After doing a study about the different systems to monitor and analyse the postural adjustments, we proceed to explain possible applications in the real life.

The force plate system is a very accurate system to analyse disorders in the patients, however it is a limited system for its price and portability. So, its applications make restricted to diagnosis some diseases.
The same happens with Qualisys System because it is necessary fixed cameras to record data. However it is a interesting way to observe data in real time with precision and robustness .

But, without a doubt, Gait Watch System is one of the most interesting system due to portability and its amount of fields where it can be used such as telerehabilitation, daily activities and performance of some athletics. This is why, the majority of applications will be focused in this system.

All of these implementations will be briefly explained below as well as a business idea as a concrete application of this Project.

\section{Diseases}
There exists a large amount of diseases that distort the motor control of human body or present symptoms that can be identified by the analysis of human body posture and motion. Along this section,  we will briefly comment how our study has influence in that.
