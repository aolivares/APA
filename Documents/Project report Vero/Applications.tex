\chapter{Potential Applications}
\label{ch:Applications}

After doing a study about the different systems to monitor and analyse the postural adjustments, we proceed to explain possible applications in the real life.

The force plate system is a very accurate system to analyse disorders in the patients, however it is a limited system for its price and portability. So, its applications make restricted to diagnosis some diseases.
The same happens with Qualisys System because it is necessary fixed cameras to record data. However it is a interesting way to observe data in real time with precision and robustness .

But, without a doubt, Gait Watch System is one of the most interesting system due to portability and its amount of fields where it can be used such as telerehabilitation, daily activities and performance of some athletics. This is why, the majority of applications will be focused in this system.

All of these implementations will be briefly explained below as well as a business idea as a concrete application of this Project.

\section{Diseases}
There exists a large amount of diseases that distort the motor control of human body or present symptoms that can be identified by the analysis of human body posture and motion. Along this section,  we will briefly comment how our study has influence in that.

\subsection{Telehabilitation}
\subsection{Neurological and Muscular diseases}
\subsection{Sleep disorder}
Sleep disorders cause an unrestful sleep and important repercussions in some cases such as sleepiness and psychiatric and cardiorespiratory secondary disorders\cite{SanchezDaniel}. 

In order to diagnose them, we can use inertial sensors to monitor changes that occur during sleep. In addition, it is a good option to do this  cheap and portable, in such a way that patient can move freely while they are being monitored\cite{A.Olivares}.

Also, the information gathered can provide information  of the cardiac, respiratory, and snoring activities of patients sleeping\cite{SanchezDaniel}.

If we use all of this at home, it is possible to provide a tool to sleep specilists for knowing the behaviour of the patient when they are sleeping, what sleep cycles are more affected and improve their medical  treatments.
