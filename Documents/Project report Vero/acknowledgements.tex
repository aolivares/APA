First and foremost, I would like to thank Dr Alberto Olivares Vicente and Juan Manuel Górriz Sáez for supervising this work, his assistance and most especially for his continuous motivation and encouragement. 

My appreciation as well to Dr. Kai Bötzel and his team from the Department of Neurology of the Klinikum Grosshadern of Munich for suggesting the project, his counseling and for providing the necessary database.

Thanks to Robin Weiss for his suggestions, his great ideas and knowledge, his jokes when the work was being  hard and, in short, for helping me along this Project.

Special thanks go to my friends for valuing my work, encouraging me every day, their advices and making me smile with their crazy things. Of course, many thanks go to my friend and flatmate, for putting up with me in the work nights and making me laugh with their positive music.

Finally, I am deeply grateful to my family, for giving me the opportunity to study, respecting all my decisions and their motivation and affection.
