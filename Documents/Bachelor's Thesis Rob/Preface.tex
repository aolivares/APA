\chapter*{Preface}

This thesis entitled ``Analysis of anticipatory postural adjustments of Parkinson's patients using inertial sensors'' was submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering awarded from the Münster University of Applied Sciences.

I took part in a conjoint project between the Research Centre for Information and Communications Technologies of the University of Granada (CITIC-UGR)\nomenclature{CITIC-UGR}{Research Centre for Information and Communications Technologies of the University of Granada} and the Department of Neurology of the Klinikum Großhadern in Munich, which is part of the Ludwig-Maximilians University. The objective of this thesis was to carry out an analysis of the so called anticipatory postural adjustments, which are the movements by a human subject between the moment he initiates gait and the first step.
