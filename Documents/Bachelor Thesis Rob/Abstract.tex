This thesis entitled ``Analysis of anticipatory postural adjustments of Parkinson's patients using inertial sensors'' was submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. 

I took part in a conjoint project between the Research Centre for Information and Communications Technologies of the University of Granada (CITIC-UGR) and the Department of Neurology of the Klinikum Gro√ühadern in Munich, which is part of the Ludwig-Maximilians University. The objective of this thesis was to carry out an analysis of the so called anticipatory postural adjustments, which are the movements by a human subject between the moment he initiates gait and the first step.
