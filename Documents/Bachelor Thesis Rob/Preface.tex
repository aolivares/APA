\chapter*{Preface}

I took part in a conjoint project between the \gls{CITIC-UGR} and the Department of Neurology of the Klinikum Gro√ühadern in Munich, which is part of the Ludwig-Maximilians University. The objective of this thesis was to carry out an analysis of the so called anticipatory postural adjustments, which are the movements by a human subject between the moment he initiates gait and the first step.
