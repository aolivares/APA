\chapter{Preface}

This thesis was submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. It describes the implementation of a new Kalman-filter-based orientation algorithm that improves the estimation of the pitch angles from inertial data of the lower extremities. I took part in the joint research project “\mbox{Human} Body Motion Analysis of Patients with Neurodegenerative Diseases by Means of Inertial Sensors” between the \gls{CITIC-UGR}, Spain, and the Department of Neurology of the Klinikum Großhadern, which is part of the Ludwig Maximilian University of \mbox{Munich}, Germany. The goal of the overall project was to obtain several gait parameters by wearable inertial sensors and validate them against conventional methods, such as cameras in combination with visual markers and force measuring platforms. Prior to this thesis, I completed a three-month internship at the \gls{CITIC-UGR}, in which I worked on the synchronisation of a force measuring platform with inertial sensors within the above-mentioned project.
