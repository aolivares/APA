\chapter{MARG Sensors}
\label{ch:MARG}

MARG sensors is a collective term for magnetic, angular rate, and gravitational sensors, which encompasses inertial sensors, as well as magnetic field sensors, also referred to as magnetometers. Inertial sensors itself generally fall into two categories: instruments sensing linear inertial displacement (accelerometers) and rotational inertial rate sensors (gyroscopes). They are applied in various contexts to quantify vibration, motion, and shock \cite{bhattacharyya_inertial_sensors_applications_13}. Particularly, the development of \gls{MEMS} opened up many medical applications as mentioned in Section \ref{sec:MARG_sensors_medical}. This chapter compiles the functional principles of MARG sensors and introduces \glspl{IMU} as a combination of those. At the end of the chapter the aforementioned GaitWatch device that was used to gather the movement data for the experiments is described in detail.

\section{Accelerometers}

Accelerometers measure the acceleration of an object relative to an inertial frame. Since acceleration cannot be measured directly, the force exerted to a reference mass is obtained. The resultant acceleration is computed according to Newton's second law $\mathbf{f} = m \cdot \mathbf{a}$, where $ \mathbf{f} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ denotes the force vector, $m$ the mass, and $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ the acceleration vector. Usually, an accelerometer consists of a small proof mass connected via a spring to the case of the instrument. The proof mass is displaced  by $\Delta x$ with respect to the case, when the instrument experiences a certain acceleration along its sensitive axis. Disregarding drag force, the displacement is directly proportional to the force exerted by the mass and thus to the acceleration. Therefore, by measuring the displacement of the proof mass the acceleration can be obtained. Figure \ref{fig:accelerometer} shows the displacement $\Delta x$ of the mass in respect to the case of the instrument for three different conditions: (a) at rest or in uniform motion, (b) accelerating, and (c) at rest, being exposed to the gravity $g$. According to how the mass displacement is sensed, accelerometers can be classified as resistive, capacitive, and piezoelectric. Besides there are surface acoustic wave, fibre optic, vibrating beam and solid-state \gls{MEMS} accelerometers. To obtain a three-dimensional accelerometer, three single-axis accelerometers are mounted together. Although a mutually orthogonal mount is common practice, any non-coplanar arrangement is acceptable, as long as the angles between the sensitive axes are known. Nowadays most accelerometers are manufactured using MEMS technology, which was developed for the military and aerospace markets in the 1970s \cite{bhattacharyya_inertial_sensors_applications_13}.

\section{Gyroscopes}

A Gyroscope is a device for measuring angular orientation based on the principle of preserving angular momentum. A spinning rotor tends to maintain the direction of its spin axis. This so-called Coriolis Effect is used to measure angular velocity. Gyroscopes are also referred to as angular velocity sensors or angular rate sensors. By integrating the angular velocity the rotation angle can obtained \cite{olivares_vicente_signal_2013}.

\section{Magnetometers}

Magnetometers measure the strength and the direction of the magnetic field at a point in space, using the relationship between magnetic fields, movement and induced currents \cite{olivares_vicente_signal_2013}.

\section{Inertial Measurement Units}

Devices using a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure the orientation of a rigid body with up to six degrees of freedom are referred to as \glspl{IMU}. If they include additional magnetometers they are termed \glspl{MIMU} and can obtain the orientation of the body with up to nine degrees of freedom, whereby the number of degrees of freedom states the number of independent motions, with respect to a reference frame, that are allowed to the body in space.

\glspl{MIMU} are portable and relatively inexpensive. They can be easily attached to the body and thus allow non-clinical longterm application. Their drawbacks are complex calibration procedures and drift behaviour over time, depending on intensity and duration of the measurement interval. Hence, in order to maintain a satisfactory degree of precision, periodical recomputation of the calibration parameters is required \cite{olivares_vicente_signal_2013}.

\section{The GaitWatch}

The above mentioned GaitWatch device we used to gather the movement data was designed to monitor the motion of patients while attached to the body. It was developed at the Department of Neurology of the Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, Germany, in association with the Department of Signal Theory, Telematics and Communications of the University of Granada, Spain. The system is composed of a set of embedded magnetic and inertial sensors wired to a box containing a microcontroller. This microcontroller is in charge of collecting data from the embedded box sensors, as well as from the external measurement units, and storing them on a memory card. The various units are placed at the patient's trunk, arms, thighs, and shanks as shown in Figure \ref{fig:GaitWatch_placement}. The components of the three different kinds of subunits are described below:
