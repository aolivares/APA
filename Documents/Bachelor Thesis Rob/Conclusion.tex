\section{Conclusions}

%Gait analysis is a useful tool both in clinical practice and biomechanical research. In order to replace motion capture systems with low cost wearable \gls{MARG} sensors detailed technical matters still need to be improved \cite{tao_gait_2012}.
%
%Summarising the above, I can say that I have learned a lot in the four month that I spent in Granada. Amongst others I have come to know many new work methods, not only due to being exposed to people from a different culture, but also due to the fact that scientific research differs strongly from the work as a student at university. I gained a deeper understanding of orientation estimation and how Kalman filtering improves those. Therefore I had to study the principles of Kalman filters as well as the basics of MARG sensors. I was able to improve my MATLAB$\textsuperscript{\textregistered}$ skills and have realised how important it is to write understandable and well commented code, if it is for a larger project and not only for a coursework. I am now familiar with tools such as GitHub and Pivotal Tracker which make working in a team much easier and significantly more efficient.  Beside my work at the research centre, where I obtained a valuable insight into scientific research, I read a book about scientific writing that helped me to improve my oral and written English skills during my stay. Furthermore I now know the fundamentals of \LaTeX{}.
%
%All in all it was a great experience, professionally as well as personally. I truly and unreservedly recommend such a stay to \emph{every} university student.

\section{Future Work}

%Medical engineering is a very interesting blend of both my major interests, that is, working in the medical field as a paramedic and  in the technical field as an electrical engineer. There is a variety of possible future work. One related topic would be the validation of the pitch angles measured with the gyroscopes of the GaitWatch by means of cameras that record the trace of visual markers. From these markers one could compute the pitch angels and compare them to the those of the GaitWatch.
