\section{Conclusions}

Gait analysis is a useful tool both in clinical practice and biomechanical research. In this work I implemented an extended Kalman filter along with some auxiliary routines that . and showed that motion-based acceleration correction can improve the angle estimates during faster motion. In order to replace a camera-based motion capture system with low cost wearable MARG sensors, some technical deails need to be improved. One could use a more complex mathematical model of the leg that takes motions outside 

Summarising the above, I can say that I have learned a lot in the four month that I spent in Granada. Amongst others I have come to know many new work methods, not only due to being exposed to people from a different culture, but also due to the fact that scientific research differs strongly from the work as a student at university. I gained a deeper understanding of orientation estimation and how Kalman filtering  benefits the accuracy. I improved my MATLAB$\textsuperscript{\textregistered}$ skills and I am now familiar with tools such as GitHub and Pivotal Tracker which make working in a team much easier and significantly more efficient.  While working at the research centre, I obtained a valuable insight into scientific research and could improve my oral and written English skills. Furthermore I now know the fundamentals of \LaTeX{}.

All in all it was a great experience, professionally as well as personally. I truly and unreservedly recommend such a stay to \emph{every} university student.

\section{Future Work}

%Medical engineering is a very interesting blend of both my major interests, that is, working in the medical field as a paramedic and  in the technical field as an electrical engineer. There is a variety of possible future work. One related topic would be the validation of the pitch angles measured with the gyroscopes of the GaitWatch by means of cameras that record the trace of visual markers. From these markers one could compute the pitch angels and compare them to the those of the GaitWatch.
