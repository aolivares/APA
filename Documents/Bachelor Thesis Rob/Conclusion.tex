\section{Conclusions}

Gait analysis is a useful tool both in clinical practice and biomechanical research. In this work I implemented an extended Kalman filter along with some auxiliary routines that. The experiments showed that motion-based acceleration correction can improve the angle estimates while walking at different speeds. In order to replace a camera-based motion capture system with low cost wearable MARG sensors, some technical details need to be improved. One could use a more complex mathematical model of the leg that takes motions of the hip joint into account.

Personally, I can say that I have learned a lot in the seven months I spent in Granada for writing this thesis and completing the prior internship. Amongst others, I have come to know many new work methods, due to being exposed to people from a different culture, and due to gathering some experience in scientific research. I gained a deeper understanding of human body motion analysis and particularly gait analysis, as well as how Kalman filtering benefits the accuracy of orientation estimation. I improved my MATLAB$\textsuperscript{\textregistered}$ skills and I am now familiar with tools such as GitHub and Pivotal Tracker which make working in a team much easier and significantly more efficient.  While working at the research centre, I could improve my oral and written English skills. Furthermore I now know the fundamentals of \LaTeX{}.

All in all it was a great experience, professionally as well as personally. I truly and unreservedly recommend such a stay to \emph{every single} university student.

\section{Future Work}

There is a variety of possible future work. One could extend the kinematic model of the leg, in order to take more complex movements of the body into account. Furthermore the implemented orientation algorithm needs to be tested with data from real subjects, in order to proof its validity. Especially, the robustness of the algorithms needs to be tested, that is, whether it delivers accurate orientation estimations without fine tuning the parameters by means of a known reference for every patient and trial.

Regarding the GaitWatch system itself, the acceleration correction could be extended to the orientation estimation of the arms and the trunk. Then it could replace the camera-based motion capture systems in the future.
