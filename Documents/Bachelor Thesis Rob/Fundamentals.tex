\section{Inertial Sensors}

Devices that use a combination of inertial sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes are referred to as inertial measurement units (IMUs). If they also include magnetic field sensors (magnetometers), they are called magnetic inertial measurement units (MIMUs){Magnetic Inertial Measurement Unit}. With these devices the orientation of the body can be obtained with up to nine degrees of freedom, provided that triaxial accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers are used, respectively \cite{olivares_vicente_signal_2013}.
