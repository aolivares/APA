\chapter*{Preface}

This report presents my practical work within the Project ``Analysis of Anticipatory Postural Adjustments of Parkinson's Patients using Inertial Sensors'' at the Research Centre for Information and Communications Technologies of the University of Granada (CITIC-UGR). The Muenster University of Applied Sciences required an intership of at least 10 weeks prior to the final bachelor's thesis.
