This report presents my practical work within the Project ``Analysis of anticipatory postural adjustments of Parkinson's patients using inertial sensors'' at the Research Centre for Information and Communications Technologies of the University of Granada (CITIC-UGR). The Münster University of Applied Sciences required an internship of at least ten weeks prior to the final bachelor's thesis.

This is a conjoint project between the University of Granada and the Department of Neurology of the Klinikum Großhadern in Munich, which is part of the Ludwig-Maximilians University. The goal of the project was to carry out an analysis of the so called anticipatory postural adjustments, which are the movements by a human subject between the moment he initiates gait and the first step. The medical community is interested in this procedure, as it can assist the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's.
