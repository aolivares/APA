	abstract = {Gait initiation is a transient movement between upright posture and steady-state gait. Kinematic, kinetic and electromyographic data have been documented in healthy young subjects. However, there is little published data on the elderly and on Parkinson's disease ({PD}) subjects who are known to 'freeze' when initiating gait. It was the purpose of this project to measure gait initiation in young, healthy elderly and {PD} subjects. The results showed many differences between the young and elderly and the elderly and {PD} subjects. However, if all dependent variables were normalized to gait velocity there were no differences at the P{\textless}0.05 level. The results showed a progressive slowing from the young to the elderly to the {PD} subjects. There does not appear to be a relationship between the {PD} subject's steady-state velocity and their age, number of years diagnosed, number of hours off medication, or the rating on the Hoehn and Yahr scale.

	abstract = {In this study, we investigated how the size of preparatory postural adjustments prior to step initiation, and step length and velocity depend on initial stance width in patients with Parkinson's disease ({PD}) both in the {ON} and {OFF} levodopa states and in healthy elderly subjects. Twenty-one subjects with idiopathic {PD} and 24 age-matched healthy control subjects took two steps starting with feet on a two-plate force-platform, from either narrow or wide stance width. We measured how the magnitude of anticipatory postural adjustments ({APA}) and step characteristics scaled with stance width. Results showed that preparation for step initiation from wide stance was associated with a larger lateral and backward center of pressure ({CoP}) displacement than from narrow stance. Velocity and length of the first step were also sensitive to initial stance conditions, probably in relation with the differences in the corresponding {APA}. On the contrary, the duration of {APA} was not significantly affected by initial stance width, but it was longer in {PD} compared to healthy subjects, and speeded up by levodopa. Although subjects with {PD} did scale up the size of their {APA} with stance width, they had much more difficulty initiating a step from a wide stance than from a narrow stance, as shown by the greater differences from control subjects in the magnitude of the {APA}. Our results support the hypothesis that {PD} subjects maintain a narrow stance as a compensation for their inability to sufficiently increase the size of their lateral {APA} to allow fast step initiation in wide stance.},

The system used a custom built force plate that measured sway area and sway velocity based on the measured {CoP}. A stable posture is reflected by a controlled {CoP} oscillation, where the oscillation lies within the limits of stability. Large magnitudes of {CoP} oscillations (large sway area) indicate weak proprioception strength and a heightened risk of falls. Experiments carried out involved self-induced perturbations that destabilized postural control among volunteers with active and inactive lifestyles. The observed results from the experiment indicate that individuals with active lifestyle have better postural control than individuals with inactive lifestyle. Subjects with active lifestyles demonstrated greater sway velocities, while maintaining a small sway area.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To determine whether the magnitude of the separation between the center of pressure ({COP}) and the whole-body center of mass ({COM}) during gait initiation can differentiate patients with varying severity of Parkinson's disease ({PD}) disability.
{DESIGN}: Cross-sectional, intact groups research design.
{SETTING}: Biomechanics research laboratory.
{PARTICIPANTS}: Forty-three patients were stratified into 2 groups based on the Hoehn and Yahr (H\&Y) disability score, which heavily favors balance in determining disability. The 2 groups were: H\&Y score of 2.0 or less (n=23; age, 61+/-10y) or H\&Y score of 2.5 or higher (n=20; age, 70+/-9y).
{INTERVENTIONS}: Not applicable.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: The peak {COP}-{COM} distance represents the maximum separation between the location of the whole-body {COM} and the ground reaction force's {COP}, and thus is an indicator of dynamic balance control. The peak {COP}-{COM} was evaluated during 3 phases of the {COP} trajectory during a gait initiation task.
{RESULTS}: The peak magnitude of the {COP}-{COM} distance was significantly greater during the end of the single-support phase in the less disabled patients (H\&Y score {\textless}or=2.0) than in more balance disabled patients (H\&Y score {\textgreater}or=2.5) (P=.004).
{CONCLUSIONS}: The differences in {COP}-{COM} distances between these H\&Y groups suggest that patients with {PD} who have impaired postural control produce shorter {COM}-{COP} distances than do persons without clinically detectable balance impairment. This method of evaluation could prove a useful quantitative index to examine the impact of interventions designed to improve ambulation and balance in {PD}.},

Peak of backward {CoP} excursion during {APA}, considered as magnitude of {APA}, was found to depend mostly on step velocity, and, in less amount, to step length. Accelerometers detected a reliable accelerometric pattern during {APA}, and stance leg backward acceleration before stepping presents a peak with a behavior very similar to peak of {CoP} in terms of dependence on velocity and step. The results allow deduction on the role of {APA} to control step initiation, and suggest possible promising applications of portable and low-cost accelerometric sensors, to monitor motor performance in several fields as rehabilitation, clinics and closed loop applications.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the relation between impaired anticipatory postural adjustments and bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease. Patients with Parkinson's disease and age matched controls stood on a platform. In one series of experiments, they performed fast, discrete shoulder flexion or extension movements. In another series, they were required to press a trigger with the right thumb and thus to release a load that was suspended from a bar which they were holding in front of them in extended arms. One more series included catching a load on the same bar. Anticipatory changes in the activity of postural muscles before fast voluntary movements occurred in patients and controls although the patients showed higher variability of anticipatory patterns. During load dropping and catching, control subjects had reproducible, although smaller, anticipatory changes in postural muscle activity. Such changes were absent in all but one patient. Two sources of these postural perturbations were analysed. The anticipatory postural adjustments in different muscle groups may counteract perturbations of different origin. The distal to proximal sequencing of joint involvement in postural reactions may be related to different reference points and working points associated with these tasks compared with reaching limb movements. The deficit in anticipatory postural adjustments in Parkinson's disease is likely to be unrelated to bradykinesia and is more likely to reflect the deficits in the basic processes of preparation and initiation of a motor act.},

	abstract = {Tremor and bradykinesia are two prominent features of Parkinsonâs disease ({PD}). Currently, these motor symptoms are evaluated by physicians, generally using the Unified Parkinsonâs Disease Rating Scale ({UPDRS}). In addition to these short subjective physicianâs tests, it is desirable to develop an objective, ambulant system thoroughly assessing tremor and bradykinesia accurately over long-term. This paper presents the {PD} monitor, a measurement system using accelerometry to quantify tremor and bradykinesia. For the evaluation of tremor, rest tremor in the arm, thigh, and trunk and kinetic tremor in the arm were quantified. Bradykinesia was assessed by parameters related to arm movement, walking, and standing up. An Activity Classifier was integrated, enabling a more detailed analysis than currently available systems. The {PD} monitor was validated using measurements of six {PD} subjects receiving deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus. During the experiments, each patient wore four sensors while subsequently receiving three different stimulation settings: stimulator on, stimulator on at 80\% of the normal stimulation amplitude, and stimulator off. Concurrently, patients were recorded on video, which were rated by a physician using the {UPDRS}. A correlation analysis of the physicianâs scores and the {PD} monitor demonstrated that the system accurately measured the severity of tremor and bradykinesia whilst assessing a broad spectrum of aspects related to both symptoms. In conclusion, the {PD} monitor can be used for a detailed evaluation of the {PD} motor symptoms in order to optimize treatment.},

The {HMM} method could effectively separate the gait data in terms of stride interval obtained from healthy subjects and {PD} patients with an accuracy rate of 90.3 \% . All in all, the results showed that the proposed method can be used for distinguishing {PD} patients from healthy subjects based on the gait data classification.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: Anticipatory postural adjustments ({APAs}), prior to step initiation, are bradykinetic in advanced Parkinson's disease ({PD}) and may be one of the factors associated with 'start hesitation'. However, little is known about {APAs} in the early stage of {PD}. In this study, we determined whether body-worn accelerometers could be used to characterize step initiation deficits in subjects with early-to-moderate, untreated {PD}.
{METHODS}: Eleven {PD} and 12 healthy control subjects were asked to take two steps. Postural adjustments were compared from center of pressure ({COP}) and from acceleration of the trunk at the center of mass level (L5).
{RESULTS}: Our findings show that {APAs} measured from the peak {COP} displacement toward the swing leg and the peak trunk acceleration toward the stance leg were smaller in untreated {PD} compared with control subjects. The magnitude of {APAs} measured from peak {COP} displacements and accelerations were correlated.
{CONCLUSION}: These results suggest that quantitative analysis of step initiation from one accelerometer on the trunk could provide useful information for the characterization of patients in early stages of {PD}, when clinical evidence of start hesitation may not be detectable. Ambulatory monitoring of step initiation is also promising for monitoring patient progression in the home environment, and eventually providing feedback for preventing freezing of gait episodes.},

Twenty {PD} and 20 control subjects, wearing an accelerometer on the lower back, were tested in five conditions characterized by sensory and attentional perturbation. A total of 175 measures were computed from the signals to quantify tremor, acceleration, and displacement of body sway. Feature selection was implemented to identify the subsets of measures that better characterize the distinctive behavior of {PD} and control subjects. It was based on different classifiers and on a nested cross validation, to maximize robustness of selection with respect to changes in the training set. Several subsets of three features achieved misclassification rates as low as 5\%. Many of them included a tremor-related measure, a postural measure in the frequency domain, and a postural displacement measure. Results suggest that quantitative posture analysis using a single accelerometer and a simple test protocol may provide useful information to characterize early {PD} subjects.

	abstract = {Human body motion monitoring is a field of growing interest mainly due to the fast evolution of miniaturized inertial and magnetic sensors. The analysis of body position and motion is very important in many fields of modern medicine, teleas- sistance and sports performance monitoring.
This work describes de development of a complete system to monitor the ori- entation of human body and the analysis of its motion using inertial (accelerom- eter and gyroscope) and magnetic (magnetometer a.k.a digital compass) sensors, making special emphasis in the design of algorithms to calibrate the sensors and estimate the orientation using the calibrated physical magnitudes. Along this doc- ument we describe, in first place, the employed measurement unit (Wagyromag) and the working principles of the embedded sensors as well as the procedures to analyze their quality and performance. In second place, we include an analysis of the existing calibration algorithms and we select the most well-known and efficient ones to carry out a comparative study. This study reveals the great importance of defining a complete mathematical model for the output of the sensors, as well as the necessity of employing homogeneously distributed data to estimate the calibration parameters. In addition, we propose two new algorithms to calibrate the gyroscope without using complex instrumentation. In third place, we analyze the existing pos- sibilities to detect the intensity of the motion which is being monitored and we also carry out a comparative study between four algorithms which have already been applied to this purpose and four new alternatives. This study reveals that two of the proposed algorithms outperform the existing algorithms as they achieve up to 97\% of accuracy distinguishing between activity and inactivity. Next, we make a meticulous dissertation about the different procedures and alternatives that can be followed to estimate the attitude (orientation) of a body moving freely in space, us- ing inertial (acceleration and angular rate) and magnetic (Earthâs magnetic field) measurements. We analyze the pros and cons of every approach and explain the sensor fusion concept. We also introduce five new fusion alternatives based on vari- ants of {LMS} and {RLS} filters, and a fusion model designed from scratch based on the Kalman filter, which precision is again analyzed by means of a comparative study. This study reveals that the accuracy of the algorithms highly depends on the ini- tial parameters and the intensity of the motion being measured. Furthermore, we propose a new fusion strategy based on the dynamic modification of the parame- ters of the fusion model based on the Kalman filter so that the algorithm can be used to estimate the orientation of a body moving with changing intensity. This dynamic variant achieves a {RMSE} of 2.1132â¦ for the estimated orientation angles, which improves the precision of many proprietary algorithms embedded in com- mercial systems. Finally, we present a summary of the different fields of application in which our system can be used, making special emphasis in those applications related with healthcare.},

	abstract = {Freezing of gait ({FoG}) is an episodic, brief inability to step that delays gait initiation or interrupts ongoing gait. {FoG} is often associated with an alternating shaking of the knees, clinically referred to as knee trembling or trembling in place. The pathophysiology of {FoG} and of the concomitant trembling knees is unknown; impaired postural adjustment in preparation for stepping is one hypothesis. We examined anticipatory postural adjustments ({APAs}) prior to protective steps induced by a forward loss of balance in 10 Parkinson's disease ({PD}) subjects with marked {FoG} and in 10 control subjects. The amplitude and timing of the {APAs} were determined from changes in the vertical ground-reaction forces recorded by a force plate under each foot and were confirmed by electromyographic recordings of bilateral medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior and tensor fascia latae muscles. Protective steps were accomplished with a single {APA} followed by a step for control subjects, whereas {PD} subjects frequently exhibited multiple, alternating {APAs} coexistent with the knee trembling commonly observed during {FoG} as well as delayed, inadequate or no stepping. These multiple {APAs} were not delayed in onset and were of similar or larger amplitude than the single {APAs} exhibited by the control subjects. These observations suggest that multiple {APAs} produce the knee trembling commonly associated with {FoG} and that {FoG} associated with a forward loss of balance is caused by an inability to couple a normal {APA} to the stepping motor pattern.},

	abstract = {The Movement Disorder Society Task Force for Rating Scales for Parkinson's disease ({PD}) prepared a critique of the Hoehn and Yahr scale ({HY}). Strengths of the {HY} scale include its wide utilization and acceptance. Progressively higher stages correlate with neuroimaging studies of dopaminergic loss, and high correlations exist between the {HY} scale and some standardized scales of motor impairment, disability, and quality of life. Weaknesses include the scale's mixing of impairment and disability and its non-linearity. Because the {HY} scale is weighted heavily toward postural instability as the primary index of disease severity, it does not capture completely impairments or disability from other motor features of {PD} and gives no information on nonmotor problems. Direct clinimetric testing of the {HY} scale has been very limited, but the scale fulfills at least some criteria for reliability and validity, especially for the midranges of the scale (Stages 2â4). Although a âmodified {HY} scaleâ that includes 0.5 increments has been adopted widely, no clinimetric data are available on this adaptation. The Task Force recommends that: (1) the {HY} scale be used in its original form for demographic presentation of patient groups; (2) when the {HY} scale is used for group description, medians and ranges should be reported and analysis of changes should use nonparametric methods; (3) in research settings, the {HY} scale is useful primarily for defining inclusion/exclusion criteria; (4) to retain simplicity, clinicians should ârate what you seeâ and therefore incorporate comorbidities when assigning a {HY} stage; and (5) because of the wide usage of the modified {HY} scale with 0.5 increments, this adaptation warrants clinimetric testing. Without such testing, however, the original five-point scales should be maintained. Â© 2004 Movement Disorder Society},

	volume = {924},
	issn = {0006-8993},
	abstract = {Two different schemes of the central organization of anticipatory postural adjustments ({APAs}) have been proposed: one of them assumes that postural and focal components of an action are results of a single control process (single-process hypothesis) while the other one suggests that these two components result from two relatively independent control processes (dual-process hypothesis). To distinguish between the two hypotheses, we investigated changes in the relative timing of the postural and focal components under self-paced, simple reaction time ({SRT}) and choice reaction conditions ({CRT}). Standing subjects performed one of four small arm movements resulting in a standard postural perturbation (dropping a load). {APAs} were quantified as changes in the background muscle activity as well as shifts of the center of pressure. {APAs} occurred at a larger delay prior to the focal movement under the self-paced condition than under the {SRT} condition. Under the {CRT} condition, actual {RTs} were longer than under {SRT}, but {APAs} were more similar to those under self-paced conditions. A negative correlation between the reaction time and {APA} onset was found. The findings demonstrate that the focal and {APA} components of an action can be decoupled, thus supporting the dual-process hypothesis. Changes in {APAs} with action suggest a possibility of modifications of a function that transforms two parallel control signals into a single command to the focal and postural muscles, based on postural requirements and behavioral constraints.},

	doi = {10.1016/0966-6362(96)82849-9},
	abstract = {The common denominator in the assessment of human balance and posture is the inverted pendulum model. If we focus on appropriate versions of the model we can use it to identify the gravitational and acceleration perturbations and pinpoint the motor mechanisms that can defend against any perturbation.

We saw that in quiet standing an ankle strategy applies only in the {AP} direction and that a separate hip load/unload strategy by the hip abd/adductors is the totally dominant defence in the {ML} direction when standing with feet side by side. In other standing positions (tandem, or intermediate) the two mechanisms still work separately, but their roles reverse. In the tandem position {ML} balance is an ankle mechanism (invertors/evertors) while in the {AP} direction a hip load/unloading mechanism dominates.

During initiation and termination of gait these two separate mechanisms control the trajectory of the {COP} to ensure the desired acceleration and deceleration of the {COM}. During initiation the initial acceleration of the {COM} forward towards the stance limb is achieved by a posterior and lateral movement of the {COP} towards the swing limb. After this release phase there is a sudden loading of the stance limb which shifts the {COP} to the stance limb. The {COM} is now accelerated forward and laterally towards the future position of the swinging foot. Also {ML} shifts of the {COP} were controlled by the hip abductors/adductors and all {AP} shifts were under the control of the ankle plantar/dorsiflexors. During termination the trajectory of both {COM} and {COP} reverse. As the final weight-bearing on the stance foot takes place the {COM} is passing forward along the medial border of that foot. Hyperactivity of that foot's plantarflexors takes the {COP} forward and when the final foot begins to bear weight the {COP} moves rapidly across and suddenly stops at a position ahead of the future position of the {COM}. Then the plantarflexors of both feet release and allow the {COP} to move posteriorly and approach the {COM} and meet it as quiet stance is achieved. The inverted pendulum model permitted us to understand the separate roles of the two mechanisms during these critical unbalancing and rebalancing periods.

During walking the inverted pendulum model explained the dynamics of the balance of {HAT} in both the {AP} and {ML} directions. Here the model includes the couple due to the acceleration of the weight-bearing hip as well as gravitational perturbations. The exclusive control of {AP} balance and posture are the hip extensors and flexors, while in the {ML} direction the dominant control is with the hip abductors with very minor adductor involvement. At the ankle the inverted pendulum model sees the {COM} passing forward along the medial border to the weight-bearing foot. The model predicts that during single support the body is falling forward and being accelerated medially towards the future position of the swing foot. The model predicts an insignificant role of the ankle invertors/evertors in the {ML} control. Rather, the future position of the swing foot is the critical variable or more specifically the lateral displacement from the {COM} at the start of single support. The position is actually under the control of the hip abd/adductors during the previous early swing phase.

The critical importance of the hip abductors/adductors in balance during all phases of standing and walking is now evident. This separate mechanism is important from a neural control perspective and clinically it focuses major attention on therapy and potential problems with some surgical procedures. On the other hand the minuscule role of the ankle invertors/evertors is important to note. Except for the tandem standing position these muscles have negligible involvement in balance control.},

The aim was to select reliable measures to identify and quantify the differences between the motor patterns of healthy and {PD} subjects; in order to do so, besides comparing each measure individually to find significant group differences, feature selection and classification were used to identify the distinctive motor pattern of {PD} subjects. A subset of three features (two from Turning, one from the Sit-to-Walk component), combined with an easily-interpretable classifier (Linear Discriminant Analysis), was found to have the best accuracy in discriminating between healthy and early-mild {PD} subjects.

	abstract = {Background Clinicians need a practical, objective test of postural control that is sensitive to mild neurological disease, shows experimental and clinical validity, and has good test-retest reliability. We developed an instrumented test of postural sway ({ISway}) using a body-worn accelerometer to offer an objective and practical measure of postural control. Methods We conducted two separate studies with two groups of subjects. Study I: sensitivity and experimental concurrent validity. Thirteen subjects with early, untreated Parkinsonâs disease ({PD}) and 12 age-matched control subjects ({CTR}) were tested in the laboratory, to compare sway from force-plate {COP} and inertial sensors. Study {II}: test-retest reliability and clinical concurrent validity. A different set of 17 early-to-moderate, treated {PD} (tested {ON} medication), and 17 age-matched {CTR} subjects were tested in the clinic to compare clinical balance tests with sway from inertial sensors. For reliability, the sensor was removed, subjects rested for 30 min, and the protocol was repeated. Thirteen sway measures (7 time-domain, 5 frequency-domain measures, and {JERK}) were computed from the 2D time series acceleration ({ACC}) data to determine the best metrics for a clinical balance test. Results Both center of pressure ({COP}) and {ACC} measures differentiated sway between {CTR} and untreated {PD}. {JERK} and time-domain measures showed the best test-retest reliability ({JERK} {ICC} was 0.86 in {PD} and 0.87 in {CTR}; time-domain measures {ICC} ranged from 0.55 to 0.84 in {PD} and from 0.60 to 0.89 in {CTR}). {JERK}, all but one time-domain measure, and one frequency measure were significantly correlated with the clinical postural stability score (r ranged from 0.50 to 0.63, 0.01 {\textless} p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions Based on these results, we recommend a subset of the most sensitive, reliable, and valid {ISway} measures to characterize posture control in {PD}: 1) {JERK}, 2) {RMS} amplitude and mean velocity from the time-domain measures, and 3) centroidal frequency as the best frequency measure, as valid and reliable measures of balance control from {ISway}.},

	abstract = {While several studies have shown that subjects with advanced Parkinsonâs disease ({PD}) exhibit abnormalities in sway parameters during quiet standing, abnormalities of postural sway associated with untreated {PD} have not been reported. Although not clinically apparent, we hypothesized that spontaneous sway in quiet stance is abnormal in people with untreated {PD}.

We examined 13 subjects, recently diagnosed with {PD}, who were not yet taking any anti-parkinsonian medications and 12 healthy, age-matched control subjects. Postural sway was measured with a linear accelerometer on the posterior trunk (L5 level) and compared with traditional force plate measures of sway. Subjects stood for 2Â min under two conditions: eyes open ({EO}) and eyes closed ({EC}).

One of the most discriminative measures of postural changes in subjects with untreated {PD} was the increased â{JERK}â of lower trunk in the {EO} condition, measured with the accelerometer. Root mean square and the frequency dispersion of postural sway in the {EO} condition also discriminated sway in untreated {PD} subjects compared to control subjects.

We conclude that accelerometer-based sway metrics could be used as objective measures of postural instability in untreated {PD}. Accelerometer-based analysis of spontaneous sway may provide a powerful tool for early clinical trials and for monitoring the effects of treatment of balance disorders in subjects with {PD}.},
