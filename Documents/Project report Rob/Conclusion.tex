\section{Conclusions}

Summarising the above, I can say that I have learned a lot in the four month I spent in Granada. Amongst others I have come to know many new work methods, not only due to being exposed to people from a different culture, but also due to the fact that scientific research differs strongly from the work as a student at university. I was able to improve my MATLAB$\textsuperscript{\textregistered}$ skills and have realised how important it is to write understandable and well commented code if it is for a larger project and not only for a coursework. I am now familiar with tools such as GitHub and Pivotal Tracker which make working in a team easier and much more efficient.  Besides I was able to improve my written English skills. All in all it was a great experience, professionally as well as personally.
