\section{Conclusions}

Summarising the above, I can say that I have learned a lot in the four month that I spent in Granada. Amongst others I have come to know many new work methods, not only due to being exposed to people from a different culture, but also due to the fact that scientific research differs strongly from the work as a student at university. I gained a deeper understanding of Parkinson's disease and how various gait analysis techniques are used to quantify its effects. Therefore I had to study the principles of force plates and inertial measurement units as well as the basics of classification. I was able to improve my MATLAB$\textsuperscript{\textregistered}$ skills and have realised how important it is to write understandable and well commented code, if it is for a larger project and not only for a coursework. I am now familiar with tools such as GitHub and Pivotal Tracker which make working in a team much easier and significantly more efficient.  Beside my work at the research centre, where I obtained a short but valuable insight into scientific research, I read a book about scientific writing and was able to improve my oral and written English skills. The above will hopefully serve as a good foundation for my subsequent bachelor's thesis.  All in all it was a great experience, professionally as well as personally.

\section{Future Work}

Parkinson's research in combination with technical research is a very interesting one. I would like to keep working in this field and write my aforementioned bachelor's thesis here in Granada.
