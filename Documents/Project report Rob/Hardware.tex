In this chapter we will elaborate on the hardware used to gather the data. That is, the IMU (GaitWatch) and the force plate. Furthermore we will describe the synchronisation of both systems.

\section{GaitWatch}

The GaitWatch device is an MIMU designed to monitor the motion of patients while attached to the patients’ thighs, shanks, arms and trunk. It was developed by Prof. Dr. Med. Kai Bötzel at the Department of Neurology of the Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich in conjunction with Dr. Alberto Olivares Vicente from the Department of Signal Theory, Telematics and Communications of the University of Granada.
